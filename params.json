This requires `gnuplot` installed.\r\n\r\n#### Input file\r\n\r\nThe expected format is `JOBID ARRIVAL WAITTIME RUNTIME CPUREQ RAMREQ USERID QUEUE` for each line.\r\n\r\n`ARRIVAL`, `WAITTIME`, `RUNTIME` are expected to be time offsets in seconds from the schedule start.\r\n\r\n`CPUREQ` is expected to be the number of cores requested by the job.\r\n\r\n`RAMREQ` is expected to be the number kB of RAM requested by the job.\r\n\r\n`JOBID`, `USERID`, `QUEUE` are expected to be simple string tokens (without spaces).\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
