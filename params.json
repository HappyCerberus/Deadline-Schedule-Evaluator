{"name":"Deadline Scheduler Evaluator","tagline":"Deadline-based evaluator for GRID schedules","body":"### Deadline based evaluator for GRID schedules\r\n\r\nThis tool is designed for evaluation of GRID schedules. If you need more information, you can contact the author at toth@fi.muni.cz\r\n\r\n### User Documentation\r\n\r\nUse `--help` to print a simple help overview.\r\n\r\nThe required options are `--input filename` to specify the input file, `--cpuAllowance` to specify the number of cores all users receive in their share, `--ramAllowance` to specify the number of MB of RAM all users receive in their share.\r\n\r\nTo actually generate a heatmap, also specify `--generateHeatmap`. This requires `gnuplot` installed.\r\n\r\n#### Input file\r\n\r\nThe expected format is `JOBID ARRIVAL WAITTIME RUNTIME CPUREQ RAMREQ USERID QUEUE` for each line.\r\n\r\n`ARRIVAL`, `WAITTIME`, `RUNTIME` are expected to be time offsets in seconds from the schedule start.\r\n\r\n`CPUREQ` is expected to be the number of cores requested by the job.\r\n\r\n`RAMREQ` is expected to be the number kB of RAM requested by the job.\r\n\r\n`JOBID`, `USERID`, `QUEUE` are expected to be simple string tokens (without spaces).\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Output files\r\n\r\nThe tool will generate several files. These files are named after the input filename.\r\n\r\n##### Consumption file `.consumption`\r\n\r\nThis file contains time overview of CPU and memory consumption. File contains one record (line) per-minute in the format `TIME CPU MEM`.\r\n\r\n##### Deadlines file `.deadlines`\r\n\r\nThis file contains data for heatmap generation. File contains one record for each 2D coordinate (time`x`user). Format of each line is `USERID TIME DEADLINE_COUNT`.\r\n\r\n##### Jobs file `.jobs`\r\n\r\nFile contains processed input information. File contains one record for each job in the input file. Format of each line is `JOBID ARRIVAL WAITTIME RUNTIME CPUREQ RAMREQ USERID DEADLINE_SATISFIED DEADLINE_DIFF`.\r\n\r\n`DEADLINE_SATISFIED` is a boolean representing whether the job had it's deadline violated or satisfied\r\n\r\n`DEADLINE_DIFF` is the time difference (can be both positive or negative) against the calculated deadline\r\n\r\n##### Users file `.users`\r\n\r\nFile contains processed information from the model, grouped by users. File contains one record for each user in the input file. Format of each line is `USERID JOBCOUNT VIOLATED_COUNT SUM_DIFF SUM_POSITIVE_DIFF RELATIVE_VIOLATED RELATIVE_SUM RELATIVE_SUM_POSITIVE`\r\n\r\n`VIOLATED_COUNT` is the total number of violated deadlines for this user\r\n\r\n`SUM_DIFF` is the total sum of all differences between calculated deadlines and actual job end times\r\n\r\n`SUM_POSITIVE_DIFF` is the total sum of differences between calculated deadlines and actual job end times for jobs that didn't meet their deadline\r\n\r\n`RELATIVE_VIOLATED` relative count of violated deadlines `VIOLATED_COUNT/JOBCOUNT`\r\n\r\n`RELATIVE_SUM` and `RELATIVE_SUM_POSITIVE` are relative variants of `SUM_DIFF` and `SUM_POSITIVE_DIFF` (divided by `JOBCOUNT`)","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
